# Multivariate-Linear-Regression

Estimating the sale prices of houses is one of the basic projects, by realizing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing and choosing the best features to improve the model's accuracy on the price prediction. In this exercise i was able to predict continuous variables using various types of linear regression algorithms:

* Ordinal Least Square (OLS).
* Rigde Regression Algorithm.
* Lasso Regression Model.
* Bayesian Regression Algorithm.
* Elastic Net Regression Algorithm.

These algorithms can be feasibly implemented in python with the use of the scikit-learn package.
